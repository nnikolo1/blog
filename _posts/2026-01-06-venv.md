Essentialy, when running `venv` you are creating a directory structure and do any *project-specific* installations there. It is a __light-weight__ isolation which is __uni-directional__. 

It is light-weight because within that virtual enviroment (VE) you are still making use of the system python interpreter and the python standard library. However, any additional, project-specific, installations stay within the VE. In this way you don't pollute the system.

The Python standard library (e.g. os, sys, json, pathlib) is not copied into the VE. It is loaded from the base Python installation
This is considered safe.

What is also not copied are the non-python dependencies on the system (e.g. CUDA).

`uv` covers both `pip` and `venv`.
